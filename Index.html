    <p class="h2">Why the importance of Ukranian language is on time? </p>
     <div class="T3 ">
        <p class="text2 ">Language is an important object of emerging legal relations between citizens, organizations and authorities, since it is a tool for forming official, oral, written, informative messages, statements, appeals, contracts, etc. In addition, it is a social reality that requires special normative and legal regulation. The dynamism of language as a form of social consciousness and as a means of social communication, its multi-functionality allows us to talk about the existence of special linguistic relations that fall within the sphere of legal influence. The legal, and above all legislative, consolidation of the social functions of languages under the correct formulation of the question "allows to take into account the level of national and cultural self-awareness of the people, their social needs, and also creates conditions for neutralizing efforts of subjective interference in the processes of language functioning"

    <p class="h11">Executed Renaissance</p>
    <div class="renas"> For many centuries, the Ukrainian intelligentsia and ordinary people tried to destroy, bribe, deceive or hide from the world, but they could not. The "executed renaissance" became just another bloody period for haters of freedom and everything Ukrainian.The literary output of 1920s Soviet Ukraine has acquired almost legendary status in Ukrainian scholarship. It has been variously described as intense, creative, vibrant - exuding an aura of excitement and raw expressive power. Unparalleled, in quality and volume, by any other period in modern Ukrainian literature, the "executed renaissance" (rozstriliane vidrodzhennia), as it became known,' is seen as a national cultural flowering brutally crushed by the Stalinist repressions of the 1930s

    <div class="histori"> Do you know who killed the author of the world-famous Shchedrik Mykola Leontovich? <hr color="white">
        Do you know who tore off Maksym Rylskyi's mustache with a piece of skin and meat during the interrogations? <hr color="white">

        Do you know who and under which articles Serhiy Parajanov was imprisoned after the high-profile premiere of "Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors"? <hr color="white">
        Do you know who burned all the notes of Vasyl Barvinskyi in the yard of the Lviv Conservatory, and then "donated" 10 years of concentration camps together with his wife, the daughter of the famous scientist Ivan Puluy?! <hr color="white">
        Do you know why Anna Sten, Serhiy Lyfar Mykhailo Lomatskyi left abroad? And the sons of the famous Hutsul writer Peter Shekeryk Donykov, who himself went missing?! <hr color="white">
        Do you know who forbade the creation of the first theoretician of Ukrainian folk dance, Vasyl Verkhovynts? <hr color="white">

        Do you know who killed Vasyl Stus in a prison cell? <hr color="white">
        And maybe you know...? <hr color="white">
        The answer to all "you know" is known and one: Soviet power, totalitarian system, mozKali, russian cattle, which has been destroying our flowers, our artists, our language, our traditions, our culture for several centuries, and these "and you know who and why.. ." - a cloud, because russia cannot accept that Ukraine and its people are free, wise, unconquered and extremely brave. Because even under the barrel of an enemy russian machine gun, our Ukrainians joke and sing songs. <hr color="white">
        Please know. And most importantly, remember and tell others: who, why, why, for what and how. Ignorance sometimes destroys us. And unpunished evil, unfortunately, always returns... As it is now. <hr color="white">
        <div class="left">     P.S. I'm sure you can continue this list. But let me remind you about these "but you know" and at what price... <hr color="white">
